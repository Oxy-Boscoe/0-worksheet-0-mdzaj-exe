This first worksheet is to make sure that you are familiar with github and markdown, and to understand the workflow of turning in assignments.
1. All assignments need to be turned into Moodle. Moodle is where your completion tracking/grades are, comments on your homework, timestamps to check when work was turned in. Due dates in Moodle, and at the top of this page.

A workflow to complete and turn in assignments:
-In Moodle, click on assignment link. GitHub classroom will create a repository in your Github account.
-Download assignment using Github desktop OR git clone using terminal (whatever works for you, there are many ways to get a local copy of the assignments)
-Complete assignment locally, push back to your repository on GitHub
-Copy the link to your repository
-Turn in your homework in Moodle by submitting a file that has the link to your repository
-I will look over your code, comment, and possibly ask for resubmission
-If you need to resubmit your assignment, resubmit a new file with your link to Moodle. This will trigger a regrade in Moodle.
-feel free to ask any questions in your assignment
